                <p>Microstrategy is now holding approximately 132,500 bitcoin following its most
                    recent purchases. This year, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has emerged as “the
                    institutional-grade digital asset,” said Microstrategy founder Michael Saylor.

                <h3>Microstrategy Acquires More Bitcoin</h3>
                <p>Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has purchased more
                    bitcoin for its corporate treasury. Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and
                    executive chairman, tweeted Wednesday:
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>In its <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-8-k-12-28-2022.pdf"><span>filing</span></a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy
                    clarified that the 2,500
                </p>
                <p>The subsidiary bought approximately 2,395 <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC"><span> BTC</span></a> at acoins were acquired between
                    Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned subsidiary Macrostrategy.n average price of
                    $17,871 per coin between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21. It then sold about 704 <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC"><span> BTC</span></a> at $16,776
                    per coin on Dec. 22. Macrostrategy then bought about 810 more <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC"><span> BTC</span></a> at $16,845 per
                    coin on Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,656.80.
                    
                </p>
                <p>The bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold its bitcoin
                    since it began accumulating the crypto for its corporate treasury in 2020. The
                    company cited tax reasons for selling <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC"><span> BTC</span></a>. “Microstrategy plans to carry back the
                    capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the
                    extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in
                    effect, which may generate a tax benefit,” the SEC filing describes.
                    
                </p>

                <h4>Saylor said in an interview last week:</h4>
                <p>The most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the institutional
                    grade digital asset and the clarity that … there is one crypto asset that’s a digital
                    commodity … Bitcoin is that commodity</p>

                <p>The executive noted that both the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-bitcoin-is-a-commodity/"><span>chairman of the SEC</span></a> and the chair of the
                    Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have confirmed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-bitcoin-ether-are-commodities/"><span>bitcoin is a commodity.</span></a> 
                   
                </p>

                <p>Saylor previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-ceo-expects-bitcoin-to-go-into-the-millions-despite-crypto-market-sell-off/"><span> explained</span></a> that Microstrategy is investing in <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC"><span> BTC</span></a> “for the long term.”
                    He added: “Our strategy is to buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, so there’s no price target … I expect bitcoin is going to go into the millions. So, we’re very patient. We
                    think it’s the future of money.”
