                <p>Avraham Eisenberg, the crypto investor whose <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/22/mango-exploiter-gets-liquidated-after-roiling-aave-using-20m-of-borrowed-curve-tokens/"><span> “highly profitable trading strategy”</span></a>
                    drained DeFi trading platform Mango Markets of crypto worth $110 million, was
                    arrested Monday in Puerto Rico, court documents said.
                    
                </p>
                <p>The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’
                    treasury shortly after the incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S.
                    resident to face charges for his role in manipulating a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/"><span></span> decentralized-finance</a> trading
                    platform.
                    
                </p>
                <p>Eisenberg faces charges of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation,
                    according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.591629/gov.uscourts.nysd.591629.1.0.pdf"><span> a filing unsealed Tuesday</span></a>. The charges could see punishments ranging
                    from fines to prison time.
                    
                </p>
                <p>A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz alleges Eisenberg “willfully
                    and knowingly” manipulated the sale of a commodity – namely futures contracts on
                    Mango Markets.
                </p>
                <p>According to the new rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from
                    profits and be carried forward.
                    
                </p>
                <p>“Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation
                    of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called
                    Mango Markets, and other manipulative and deceptive devices and contrivances.”
