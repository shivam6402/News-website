                <h1>PayPal enables transfer of digital currencies to external wallets</h1>
                
                <p>The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell
                    crypto on its platform.After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its
                    platform in October 2020, PayPal is finally allowing users the ability to natively
                    transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and other wallets and
                    exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the
                    feature expanding to all eligible U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first batch of
                    supported coins consists of Bitcoin.
                </p>
                <p>BTC <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"><span>$16,704</span></a>, Ether ETH <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"><span>$1,217</span></a>, Bitcoin Cash BCH <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index"><span>$100</span></a>, Litecoin LTC <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index"><span>$74.58</span></a>
                </p>
                <p>In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via
                    Checkout at millions of merchant terminals. The company has been granted a full
                    Bitlicense by the New <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/about/departments/"><span> York Departmen</span></a> of Financial Services for the conduct.
                </p>
                <p>Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of
                    the application to start transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a
                    one-time ID verification before the procedure.
                </p>
                <p>Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on
                    their respective blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such
                    fees. To protect users' privacy, the firm generates a new recipient address for each
                    transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not charge fees for incoming
                    transfers.
                </p>
                <p>The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services,
                    such as central bank digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring the possibility of launching its own stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The
                    discovery came after a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin within the
                    source code of the company's iPhone app.
